# Space-Shooter-2D
 Developed a 2D space shooter game with high end graphics using Unity and C# with the help of Online Courses.
 Hello Everyone this is my first game. From a very young age I was interested in building games and in the journey of finding answers to question like these I built this game. This game is a simple space shooter game where you need to shoot the enemies to increase your score. The game is single player now and I will definitely work on multiplayer in the future. The game has some good anitmations and good graphics do check it out and let me know what you think about it. The credit for animation sprites and all the assets goes to GameDevHQ, Unity and Udemy. Definitely learned a lot during this whole journey. And Looking forward to work on my next game.
